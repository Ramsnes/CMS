Goal
Use your knowledge of WordPress content management to setup an API for consumption in your cross-course project.

Brief
In this assignment, you’ll be using the WordPress REST API to manage the products for your website deployed on Netlify. Instead of having the products hardcoded into the HTML, you will use JavaScript to fetch the list of WordPress products and display them on your site.

There are two distinct aspects to this assignment:

Setup and configure a headless WordPress + WooCommerce API
Fetch this API as a data source and display it as part of your cross-course project
This means that there is no requirement to do theming work in PHP, since WordPress is only providing API access.

Level 1 Process
Setup a WordPress instance
Install WordPress locally using your preferred tool
Install and configure the WooCommerce plugin
Add at least 5 products to WooCommerce
Designate at least 1 product as Featured
Create a Noroff admin user with a strong, unique password
Deploy your WordPress instance to a remote host (Optional, Recommended, _)
Implement WordPress API using JavaScript
Create JavaScript to fetch an array of product data from WordPress API
Create JavaScript functionality to fetch a single product’s data from WordPress API
Create JavaScript functionality to render a grid of product data in HTML as thumbnails
Filter Featured products from the list and show these in their own section
Create a Product Detail page that uses an id search parameter render a single product’s data
Make sure that all changes to your project are committed and pushed
Deploy your cross-course project to Netlify (Optional, Recommended, _)
Level 2 Process (optional)
Implement client-side sort and filter options for products. Some examples include sorting by price, filtering by custom attributes or featured status.

Please read if you are not deploying:

In order to recreate your project successfully without a deployed WordPress instance, we need additional files and information. If we do not have everything we need, we may be unable to mark your work. In order to avoid this please provide a zip export containing wp-content and a copy of your database saved as a .sql file. If we do not have these files we will be unable to test your local submission!
